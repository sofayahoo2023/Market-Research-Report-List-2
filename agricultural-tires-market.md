<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Agricultural tires can be broadly divided into two main types: radial agriculture tires and bias (crossply) agriculture tires. Radial agriculture tires are constructed with layers of cords running perpendicular to the tire's circumference, providing excellent traction and durability. They offer a smoother ride, greater fuel efficiency, and reduced soil compaction. On the other hand, bias (crossply) agriculture tires feature a crisscrossed cord construction, making them more resistant to cuts and impacts. However, they tend to have a rougher ride and lower fuel efficiency compared to radial tires.</p></p>
