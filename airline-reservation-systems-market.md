<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airline Reservation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cloud-Based</li><li>On-Premises</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Airline reservation systems are categorized into two main types: cloud-based and on-premises markets. Cloud-based systems operate over the internet, allowing airlines to access and manage reservations using remote servers. This offers flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, as the infrastructure is maintained by a third-party provider. Alternatively, on-premises systems are hosted locally by airlines, with all data stored and managed on their own servers. Although offering more control and security, this traditional approach is often more expensive and lacks the scalability and accessibility advantages of cloud-based systems.</p></p>
