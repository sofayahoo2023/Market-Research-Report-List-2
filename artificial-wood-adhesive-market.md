<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Wood Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Adhesive</li><li>Synthetic Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The artificial wood adhesive market comprises two types: natural adhesive and synthetic adhesive. Natural adhesive refers to adhesives made from organic sources such as vegetable starch, plant gum, and animal products. These adhesives are environmentally friendly but tend to have lower bonding strength. On the other hand, synthetic adhesives are artificially manufactured using chemicals. They offer stronger bonding capabilities compared to natural adhesives but may have some environmental concerns due to their chemical composition. Both types cater to the demand for wood adhesive applications but differ in their composition and performance characteristics.</p></p>
