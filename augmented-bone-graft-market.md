<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Augmented Bone Graft Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Allografts</li><li>Bone Grafts Substitutes</li><li>Cell-based Matrices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The augmented bone graft market includes three main types: allografts, bone graft substitutes, and cell-based matrices. Allografts refer to bone grafts sourced from a donor, which can be either living (bone harvested from another person) or cadaveric (bone from a deceased individual). Bone graft substitutes are synthetic materials that mimic the properties of real bone and promote bone growth. Cell-based matrices involve the use of cells, such as stem cells, combined with a scaffold material to aid in bone regeneration. These different types provide options for surgeons to choose the most suitable technique for bone reconstruction procedures.</p></p>
