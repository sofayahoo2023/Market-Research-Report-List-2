<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biological Treatment Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Fermentation</li><li>Wet Fermentation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Biological Treatment Equipment Market has two main types: dry fermentation and wet fermentation. Dry fermentation involves the decomposition of organic waste in the absence of oxygen, creating biogas and biofertilizer. It is commonly used in anaerobic digesters and produces higher methane content. On the other hand, wet fermentation takes place in the presence of water and oxygen, breaking down organic matter and producing biogas of lower methane content. It is typically utilized in wastewater treatment plants and landfill sites. Both market segments contribute to sustainable waste management and renewable energy generation.</p></p>
