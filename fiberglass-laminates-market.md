<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiberglass Laminates Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting Plastic Products</li><li>Thermoplastic Plastic Products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiberglass laminates market can be categorized into two main types: thermosetting plastic products and thermoplastic plastic products. Thermosetting plastic products are made from materials that harden irreversibly when heated, such as epoxy and polyester resins. They offer high strength and chemical resistance, making them suitable for applications like construction and electrical insulation. On the other hand, thermoplastic plastic products can be melted and reshaped repeatedly because they only undergo reversible hardening. Common thermoplastics used in fiberglass laminates include polyethylene and polypropylene, serving various industries like automotive and packaging.</p></p>
