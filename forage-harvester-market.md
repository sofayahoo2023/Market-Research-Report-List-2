<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Forage Harvester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pull-Type Forage Harvester</li><li>Self-Propelled Forage Harvester</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Forage harvester market consists of two main types: Pull-Type Forage Harvester and Self-Propelled Forage Harvester. Pull-Type Forage Harvesters are trailed behind a tractor and powered by the tractor's power take-off (PTO). They are typically smaller and more affordable, suitable for small to medium-sized operations. Self-Propelled Forage Harvesters, on the other hand, are standalone machines with their own engines and drivetrains. They offer greater power and efficiency, making them suitable for large-scale farming operations where speed and capacity are crucial.</p></p>
