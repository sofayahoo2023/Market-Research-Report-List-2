<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hard Broaching Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Pull</li><li>Spiral Pull</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hard broaching machines are used for cutting and shaping hard materials like metal. There are two main types of hard broaching machines: straight pull and spiral pull. Straight pull machines have a linear movement, where the broach is pulled straight through the workpiece. On the other hand, spiral pull machines have a rotating motion, where the broach spirals through the workpiece. Both types have their advantages and are suitable for different applications. Straight pull machines are typically used for simpler broaching operations, while spiral pull machines are preferred for more complex and precise cutting tasks.</p></p>
