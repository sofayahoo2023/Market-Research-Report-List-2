<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infant Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)</li><li>Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infant ventilators are medical devices used to support the breathing of newborns and infants. There are three main types of infant ventilators in the market. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) provides a constant flow of air or oxygen to prevent the baby's airways from collapsing. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) delivers oxygen through a mask or prongs attached to the baby's nose or mouth. Other types include high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and jet ventilation, which deliver air through small, rapid pulses or high-frequency oscillations to support the baby's breathing. These ventilators help improve respiratory function and provide vital support to infants with breathing difficulties.</p></p>
