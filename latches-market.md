<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Latches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>D-Type</li><li>SR- Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Latch market types refer to different types of latches used in electronic circuits. D-Type latches, also known as Data latches, store a binary value based on the input data when the clock signal is active. They are widely used in sequential circuits for storing and transferring data. On the other hand, SR-Type latches, also known as Set-Reset latches, have separate set and reset inputs. When the set input is active, the latch stores a '1' and when the reset input is active, it stores a '0'. These latches are commonly used in memory storage systems and in binary counters.</p></p>
