<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LED Packaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SMD Packaging</li><li>COB Packaging</li><li>CSP Packaging</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>LED packaging is classified into three main types: SMD (Surface Mount Device) packaging, COB (Chip on Board) packaging, and CSP (Chip Scale Package) packaging. SMD packaging involves placing the LED chip on a small circuit board and covering it with epoxy, providing a compact and efficient design. COB packaging involves mounting the LED chips directly onto a substrate, increasing the LED density and enabling higher power outputs. CSP packaging further reduces the size by directly mounting the LED chip onto a small substrate, eliminating the need for additional packaging materials and reducing costs.</p></p>
