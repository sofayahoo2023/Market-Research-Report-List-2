<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lever Espresso Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Type</li><li>Direct Lever Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lever espresso machines are divided into two main market types: spring type and direct lever type. In spring type machines, users manually pull down a lever, which compresses a spring. This compressed spring then forces water through the coffee grounds to extract the espresso. On the other hand, direct lever type machines rely on the user's direct force to push down the lever, which directly controls the pressure and water flow. Both types offer users a more hands-on and customizable espresso-making experience compared to automatic machines.</p></p>
