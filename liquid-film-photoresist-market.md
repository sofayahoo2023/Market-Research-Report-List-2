<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Film Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Liquid Film Photoresist Market consists of two main types: Positive Photoresist and Negative Photoresist. Positive Photoresist is a coating that is sensitive to light and becomes soluble when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. It is commonly used in the semiconductor industry for lithography processes. In contrast, Negative Photoresist is soluble in a developer solution, but areas exposed to UV light become insoluble. This type of photoresist is often utilized in printed circuit boards and other applications where selective removal of material is required. Both types play crucial roles in the manufacturing of electronic devices.</p></p>
