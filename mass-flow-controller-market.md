<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mass Flow Controller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Type</li><li>Indirect Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct type mass flow controller refers to a device that directly measures and controls the mass flow rate of a fluid (e.g., gas or liquid) within a system or process. It typically includes a sensor, actuator, and control circuitry directly connected to the flow path. On the other hand, indirect type mass flow controllers employ pressure sensors to indirectly infer the mass flow rate based on the known relationship between pressure and flow. The choice between direct and indirect types depends on the specific application requirements, accuracy, and cost considerations.</p></p>
