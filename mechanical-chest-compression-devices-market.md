<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Chest Compression Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric</li><li>Pneumatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical chest compression devices are medical tools used during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to provide chest compressions mechanically. There are two main types of mechanical chest compression devices: electric and pneumatic. Electric devices utilize an electric motor to power the compression and decompression of the chest, allowing the user to adjust the compression rate. Pneumatic devices, on the other hand, use compressed air to deliver chest compressions, typically at a fixed rate. Both types aim to provide consistent and effective chest compressions to improve patient outcomes during CPR.</p></p>
