<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Sevofluran Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Generic Drug</li><li>Original Drug</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical sevoflurane market consists of two types: generic drugs and original drugs. Generic drugs are identical replicas of the original drug that have the same active ingredient and efficacy but are typically cheaper because they are produced by different companies after the patent for the original drug has expired. Original drugs, on the other hand, are the ones initially developed and patented by the pharmaceutical company, and they hold exclusive rights to produce and sell that drug for a certain period of time. These two types offer options for consumers based on their preferences and affordability.</p></p>
