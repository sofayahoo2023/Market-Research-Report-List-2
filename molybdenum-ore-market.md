<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Molybdenum Ore Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Primary Molybdenite (MoS2)</li><li>Associated Ore</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Molybdenum ore market can be classified into two types: primary molybdenite (MoS2) and associated ore. Primary molybdenite refers to the pure form of molybdenum ore, which contains a high concentration of molybdenum sulfide. It is the most desired form as it has higher molybdenum content and requires less processing. On the other hand, associated ore refers to molybdenum combined with other minerals, such as copper or tungsten, which makes the extraction process more complex and costly. The market for associated ore is influenced by the demand for copper or tungsten, in addition to molybdenum.</p></p>
