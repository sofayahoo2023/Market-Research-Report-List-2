<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-reagent Residual Chlorine Analyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Colorimetric Measurement</li><li>Polarographic Measurement</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The non-reagent residual chlorine analyzer market is categorized into two types: colorimetric measurement and polarographic measurement. Colorimetric measurement involves the use of chemicals that react with residual chlorine to produce a color change, which is then quantified by the analyzer. On the other hand, polarographic measurement utilizes an electrode to measure the electrical current generated by the oxidation of residual chlorine in a water sample. Both methods provide accurate and efficient measurement of residual chlorine levels in water without the need for reagents.</p></p>
