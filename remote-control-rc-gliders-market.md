<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Remote Control (RC) Gliders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Motivated</li><li>Unpowered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Remote Control (RC) Gliders market can be divided into two types: motivated and unpowered gliders. Motivated gliders are equipped with a propulsion system such as an electric motor or a gas-powered engine. They rely on this system to generate thrust and maintain flight. On the other hand, unpowered gliders do not have a propulsion system and solely rely on natural forces, such as air currents and gravity, to stay aloft. They are dependent on the pilot's skills to find updrafts and thermals to maintain flight.</p></p>
