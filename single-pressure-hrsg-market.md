<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Pressure HRSG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical</li><li>Horizontal</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Single pressure HRSGs are heat recovery steam generators used in power plants. They can be categorized into two market types: vertical and horizontal. Vertical HRSGs are compact and ideal for plants with limited space, as they are installed upright. Horizontal HRSGs are larger and require more space, but they offer ease of maintenance and enhanced accessibility. Both types operate on the same principle of recovering waste heat from the exhaust gases of a gas turbine, but their configurations differ based on space requirements and plant design.</p></p>
