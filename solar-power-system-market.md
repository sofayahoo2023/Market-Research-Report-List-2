<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Power System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On Grid Solar Power System</li><li>Off Grid Solar Power System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar power system market can be categorized into two types: On-grid and off-grid systems. On-grid solar power systems are connected to the electric grid and feed excess electricity produced by solar panels back to the grid. These systems are commonly used in urban areas where a reliable grid connection is available. In contrast, off-grid solar power systems are standalone systems that operate independently of the grid. They are commonly used in remote areas or places with unreliable grid connection, providing electricity directly to the premises without any connection to the grid.</p></p>
