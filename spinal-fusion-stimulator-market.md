<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Fusion Stimulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable</li><li>Non-implantable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A spinal fusion stimulator is a medical device used to promote bone growth and fusion in patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery. There are two main types of spinal fusion stimulator markets: implantable and non-implantable. Implantable spinal fusion stimulators are surgically implanted devices that deliver electrical stimulation directly to the fusion site. Non-implantable spinal fusion stimulators, on the other hand, are external devices that use a wearable electrical stimulation system placed outside the body. Both types aim to provide electrical stimulation to enhance bone healing and spinal fusion, but differ in their approach and placement.</p></p>
