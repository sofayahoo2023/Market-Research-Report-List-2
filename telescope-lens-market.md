<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Telescope Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concave</li><li>Convex</li><li>Concave-convex</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Telescope lenses come in different market types, including concave, convex, and concave-convex lenses. A concave lens is thinner at the center and thicker at the edges, causing light rays to diverge. This type of lens is commonly used in eyeglasses to correct nearsightedness. In contrast, a convex lens is thicker at the center and thinner at the edges, converging light rays. These lenses are used in telescopes to gather and focus light. Lastly, a concave-convex lens has one concave and one convex surface, combining the properties of both types for specific optical needs.</p></p>
