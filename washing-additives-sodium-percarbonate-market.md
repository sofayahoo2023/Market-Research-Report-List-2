<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Washing Additives Sodium Percarbonate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>COP (Sodium Percarbonate, Coated)</li><li>WPC (Sodium Percarbonate, Uncoated)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Washing additives like Sodium Percarbonate come in two main types: COP and WPC. COP, which stands for Sodium Percarbonate Coated, refers to the product that has a protective coating applied to it. This coating helps to keep the Sodium Percarbonate stable and prevents it from clumping together. On the other hand, WPC, or Sodium Percarbonate Uncoated, is the product without any protective coating. While both types serve the purpose of a washing additive, the difference lies in their stability and clumping tendency.</p></p>
