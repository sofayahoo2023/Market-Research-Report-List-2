<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Welded Plate Heat Exchangers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-welded</li><li>Fully-welded</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Welded Plate Heat Exchangers are available in two main types: Semi-welded and Fully-welded. Semi-welded heat exchangers feature selectively welded plates, enabling maintenance and cleaning of the gasketed areas. This type is suitable for applications with aggressive fluids or high temperatures. On the other hand, Fully-welded heat exchangers have all the plates permanently welded, ensuring no contact between the two fluids. This type is ideal for applications that require a higher level of safety and reliability, as well as those dealing with refrigerants or hazardous fluids.</p></p>
